# Seasons React.JS practice App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
This project comprises a basic React app for displaying the season (winter/summer) based on a user's location and time of year.  If the user is in the northern hemisphere and the current date is between the colder months of October-March then a message indicating it is cold is displayed - "Brrr... it's cold" along with winter 'snowflake' icons.  Likewise, if a user is located in the southern hemisphere for those same months, then a message indicating it is warm is displayed - "Let's hit the beach" along with 'sun' icons.  The reverse is true for the other six months of the year.  We leverage [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/) for basic styling of this app to ensure the project's primary focus is practicing React JS concepts.  

This project is part of practice exercises for Stephen Grider's Udemy course, [Modern React with Redux](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-redux/).  The project helps practice using core React JS concepts including the following:  
1) Building Content with JSX
2) Communicating with Props
3) Structuring Apps with Class-Based Components
4) State in React Component
5) Understanding Lifecycle Methods
6) Handling User Input with Forms and Events

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
